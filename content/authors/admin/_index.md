## About Me

I study computer coding and data-driven work as rhetorical communication. My research interests include the rhetorics of data science work and developing new approaches to community-engaged and self-determined Indigenous Data Sovereignty.

Some of my past research has studied how capitalistic rhetoric has impacted calls for coding as the new mass literacy and using novel methods to study the communication design of digital platforms as political infrastructure. Overall, my research, teaching, and community-outreach projects take up a design justice approach to digital communication.
