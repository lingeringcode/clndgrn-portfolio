abstract: This article applies stasis to analyze the impact of situated decisions on quantitative work. I analyze a sample of situations as a data-journalism team discuss the meaning and use of data, when directly mediated by the data itself. Findings show how questions of quality were central to team discussions of potential story ideas and understanding the data and its potential uses within the scope of the potential story.
