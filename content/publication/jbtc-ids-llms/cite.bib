	abstract = {In this article, we assess the data practices of the prominent AI-assisted writing technology, Grammarly, by applying data principles that advocate for empowering Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov). Our assessment is informed by our work with an Inuit tribal organization from rural Arctic Alaska that generates data and metadata about potentially sacred tribal activities. Our analysis of Grammarly’s large-language modeling practices demonstrates how technical communication can hold businesses to principled data practices created by Indigenous nations and communities who understand how to create more just futures.},
