## About Me

I study computer coding and data-driven work as rhetorical forms of critical communication. I'm invested in questions like *How are coding and data work social and rhetorical practices?*, *How do coding and data work perpetuate or create new societal problems?*, and *How can we help technical professionals find value in a humanities perspective on their practices?*

Some of my past research has studied how capitalistic rhetoric has impacted calls for coding as the new mass literacy of our time. Overall, my research, teaching, and community-outreach projects take up a design justice approach to digital communication.
