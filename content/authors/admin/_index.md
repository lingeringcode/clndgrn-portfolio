I'm an Assistant Professor of Technical Communication & Data Visualization in the English Department at Virginia Tech, where I teach courses in technical communication, literacies, and digital-cultural rhetorics of technology. I am also currently the Chair of the Special Interest Group on the Writing and Rhetorics of Code ([SIGWROC](https://wroc.netlify.app/)).

My research engages the intersections of critical code and critical data studies by studying computer coding as a culturally dynamic form of writing with data, as opposed to simply a result of automated technology alone. You can learn more about this way of understanding coding through my article, '[Writing with data: A study of coding on a data-journalism team](https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088320968061)."

I also apply computational social science methods to feminist and anti-racist rhetorical theories, as a means to differently understand social relationships in digital environments. 

<!-- I am currently collaborating on 3 such projects:

  1. A case-study of 3 Twitter hashtag groups, each of which responded to Trump's plans to build the border wall before, during, and after his administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated children from their families: #FamiliesBelongTogether, #BuildTheWall, and environmentalists opposed to the borderwall. We are examining user participation across these hashtag groups, and their respective rhetorical framing of the issue, to better understand how digital platforms actually "redraw" material nation-state borders on their platforms, which impacts digital activism.
  2. A citation politics study in my discipline of Writing &amp; Rhetoric, which aims at monitoring and addressing any issues with the frequency and manner by which scholars who are multiply marginalized are cited and taken up over time and in particular journals.
  3. An Inuit-led rematriation project that will develop a digital community-learning archive that centers their communities' needs. We aim at bringing back Inuit knowledges that have been studied and discussed by academics but only for academics. -->
